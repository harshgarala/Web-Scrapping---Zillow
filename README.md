# Web-Scrapping---Zillow

The idea is to scrap the Zillow website for 'Houses For Sale' listing and create a tabular output containing all the necessary attributes like Address , Price, #Beds, Square Feet, etc.

The function takes in 2 arguments- one is the town/city and other would be the number of pages to scrap from Zillow website.
